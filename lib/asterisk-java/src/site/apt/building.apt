Building with Maven

  Retrieve the latest version of Asterisk-Java from SVN:

---
svn co http://svn.reucon.net/repos/asterisk-java/trunk asterisk-java
---
  
  Then change to the created asterisk-java directory and use Maven2 to
  build the project
  
---
cd asterisk-java
mvn install
---

  This will create the asterisk-java-${VERSION}.jar in the target subdirectory
  as well as in your local maven repository.
