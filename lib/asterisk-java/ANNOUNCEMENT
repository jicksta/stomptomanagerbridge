ANNOUNCEMENT: Asterisk-Java 0.3.1 released

Asterisk-Java 0.3.1, the free Java library for Asterisk PBX integration,
has been released.

The Asterisk-Java package consists of a set of Java classes that allow
you to easily build Java applications that interact with an Asterisk
PBX Server. Asterisk-Java supports both interfaces that Asterisk 
provides for this scenario: The FastAGI protocol and the Manager API.

Asterisk-Java 0.3.1 is a maintenance release that solves the 
following issues:
    * [AJ-81] - executeCliCommand() always executes "show voicemail users"
    * [AJ-86] - getChannelByName doesn't return the latest channel
    * [AJ-80] - getMeetMeRooms() should only return active rooms
    * [AJ-68] - Support for Bridge Action
    * [AJ-74] - Support Strategy property in QueueParamsEvent

Asterisk-Java takes advantage of the features of Java 5.0 and therefore
requires a Java Virtual Machine of at least version 1.5.0.

Asterisk-Java is used in several commercial environments and by
the following Open Source projects:
    * Asterisk-JTAPI
      JTAPI implementation for Asterisk.

      integrated presence between your IM client and phone, notification
      of incoming calls by IM and originate calls from supported IM
      clients.
